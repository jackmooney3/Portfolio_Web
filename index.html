                    I started making videos when I was 11 because I wanted to make people laugh. I have a different point of view because my brain is not like everyone elseâ€™s. I want other kids who think like me to see that they can be creative.

                    My photos and videos portray nature and liminal spaces. One of my pictures of an escalator in Amsterdam was accepted for display at Drexel University.

                    After high school, I want to make graphic design projects. My goal is to use photography to inspire people and document the world around me.
